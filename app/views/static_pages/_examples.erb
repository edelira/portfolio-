      <p>Living near the CTA Pink Line, I wanted to visually see where the train I had to catch to get to school on time was.
      Using a Raspberry Pi and Chicago's CTA API, I was able to write a program to parse through the XML provided and 
      assign each LED on a LED strip a train station.</p>

      <p>From my Pink Line project, I saw how much fun I can have using addressable LED strips and so I thought; why not use them to
      notify me of the current weather? Using Open Weather Map's API, I was able to pull current weather data and write different 
      functions to try and replicate weather patterns.
